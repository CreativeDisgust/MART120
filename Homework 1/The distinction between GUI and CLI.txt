The distinction between GUI and CLI
Anthony Aubert

GUI and CLI interfaces make up the two primary ways for a computer to show information.
A GUI or graphical user interface is what we’re most used to these days. A GUI is any
interface that you interact with that has graphics. This could be your computer's operating
system when you're looking at the desktop. This could also be your phone or a video game.

Next to that we have the CLI interface or the command line interface. This is entirely text
interface with no option for graphics outside of “ASCII” art that is made up of text
characters. This interface is not often used these days in the consumer market outside of
rarely opening a Linux terminal or a windows command prompt. It still has a lot of use in
commercial, educational and technical products
